The purpose of this readme is to explain the basic usage of PicSorter.

How to run:
	Run PicSorter by executing the .jar file called Home.jar
	
Using the program:
	Once the program has opened, select a folder containing images by clicking 
	on the Open Folder button. A file browser will then be brought up. Browse to
	a folder containing images and click Open. Note that this folder may contain
	subfolders within it. These subfolders will also be searched for duplicates.
	
	If no duplicates are found, a pop-up will tell you this. Otherwise, a number
	of images will be loaded underneath the Open Folder button. Clicking on one
	of these images will open up a new window containing all the images which the
	program believes to be duplicates of that original image. Select those which
	you wish to delete or move by clicking on them. Then use the Move Selected 
	Photos or Delete Selected Photos buttons. These buttons will perform the 
	selected action on all the highlighted images.
	
	Move Selected Photos will open a file browser. The images you selected will be
	moved to the folder you select in the file browser.
	
	Delete Selected Photos will __permanently__ delete the selected files. A pop-up
	will ask if you are sure that you wish to permanently delete the photos.
	
	After you are done working on these images you may exit the frame by clicking the
	exit button in the top left. Then you may select another set of duplicates and
	repeat the process. When you are done, you may exit the program at any time, there
	is no need to save your changes. 
	
Dependencies:
	This program uses Java. It runs using the Java virtual machine however so there
	should be no issues even if the computer does not have Java installed.
